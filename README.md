# scoterAnimator
PoC project: animated chart showing nocturnal migration of Common Scoter across the UK

## Example output
![](https://github.com/dbradnum/scoterAnimator/blob/master/output/scoter_2020-04-01.gif)

## To run...  
... see animateTheScoter.R

## Missing bits...
* pull data straight from Google Sheets doc, rather than a copy
* get a nicer base map - eg from Stamen tiles - though this will likely need more faffing about with animation output quality
